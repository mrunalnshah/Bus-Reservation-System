It took me 3 cycles to write the code. 1st time i wrote, it went horrible. 2nd time, the recursion happened so hard that i could not handle that. this is 3rd time and i am feeling happy.

maybe this code have more bugs, but trust me, its worth if you can just read it. i used so many core concepts like cross-platform comaptiblity and file handling, with pointers ( malloc ) and soo much...

Thanks </br>

A C based project ,
Bus Reservation System is a C Program which has :
  1. Windows Compatible:
      * Windows ( CODED IN IT, USING VISUAL STUDIO 2022 ) { Build for windows only }
      * Linux ( Needs minor changes like coding itoa function, alternative of conio, and some basic changes ) 
  2. A login system, where Users and Admins can login.
      * ADMIN LOGIN :
          * Username : admin
          * Password : admin
  3. User Registration, which is stored in files.
  4. Bus Ticket Booking, where user and/or admin can book tickets of available buses.
  5. Bus Ticket Cancellation, where users and/or admin can cancel single tickets at a time for available buses.
  6. Bus Journey Registration, where admin can register buses for future journey.
  7. Bus Journey Cancellation, where admin can cancel bus journey.
  8. All this features of ticket booking, cancellation, bus registration and bus cancellation are powered with time validation, you cannot book/cancel, register/deregister buses after time period.
  9. A good file management system where we create directories, files and store data for long term use.
  10. A structured Quality of code for better useability.
  11. NO USE OF RECURSION IN THE CODE.
  12. A Maintained errorCode handling function which takes code and handles error with ease.
  13. Didnot use any new functions besides basic C libraries, for file i have used fscanf, fprintf only.
  14. User friendly readable code.

# Read the code ?

1. Open bus-reservation-system.c and bus-reservation-system.h , start reading from main 
2. Go through every file in src.
3. Its intuitive and easy to read.

# Run the code ?

1. Its cmake file, please check the latest commands to compile cmake file. cmake, then make and run the executable file.
2. you can also use Visual Studio and open a exisiting folder, and run the code in visual studio ( i used VS 2022 )
3. any compiler works, you just need to compile all files, make objs and then link them ( i dont recommend this one )
