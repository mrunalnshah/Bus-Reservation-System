It took me 3 cycles to write the code. 1st time i wrote, it went horrible. 2nd time, the recursion happened so hard that i could not handle that. this is 3rd time and i am feeling happy.

maybe this code have more bugs, but trust me, its worth if you can just read it. i used so many core concepts like cross-platform comaptiblity and file handling, with pointers ( malloc ) and soo much...

Thanks </br>
