# Bus-Reservation-System
 This system is based on a concept to reserve bus tickets. From this system, the user can view bus list, book tickets, cancel bookings and check bus status board.While booking tickets, the user has to enter bus number then the system displays total bus seat numbers with passengers name and the user has to enter the number of tickets, seat number, and name of the person. Here, cancel booking also features refunding. Login system is also available in this system to make it more secure. There’s no chance of data misuse or loss & it’s not time-consuming.  Other-side of the project come with the login as admin, where a admin can register new buses for booking tickets for users and can also register new users so that users can login and avail the user part of the system. The whole project is developed in ‘C’ Programming language, different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. It’s easy to operate and understand by users.
 
 i personally used Code::Block to code the project and have shared the cbp file which is code::block project file so if you install code::block and open the file it will open all the files attached with it, making it easy to read the code and run the code at a time. 
 
 i made this System in Code::block and on Windows system. so if you have bugs/errors or any suggestion kindly contact me as i am willing to make things better if possible.
